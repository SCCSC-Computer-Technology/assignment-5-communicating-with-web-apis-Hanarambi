There seems to be a lot going on with this code which seems to be John’s MO. that said I like the catch statements you put in your controller, that was not something I had thought to do and will try to remember it going forward. It looks like you tried to put the API in the StudentProfileWebApp. I think this might have been due to some confusion about the assignment and expected output. I believe I simply added things to the home controller and the Program.cs file in the original API and submitted it thinking I nailed it. I have watched a lot of videos on API and MVC since then and realize now that I was only kinda right, and even then I think i was off the mark based on the assignment brief. The views look good and I liked the idea about using the if statement to make sure you’re not trying to display info for a student if the ID is null.
